Installation
Before anything, you need to make sure you have Docker properly setup in your environment. For that, refer to the official documentation for both Docker and Docker Compose. 

This project depends on having jwilder/nginx-proxy running. This is a reverse proxy container that will allow having multiple projects running on port 80.

You need to also make sure you have Installed composer in your environment.

Clone this project into the local directory structure

git clone https://github.com/idesai1210/bluestarsports-roster-bots.git <new-directory-name>
Cd into the directory. and cd into the directory 'rosterbots'

Run composer to get all the dependencies up and running using the following command:

composer install

Run tests using phpUnit using the following command:

composer test

Build and run the containers:

docker-compose up -d

Next weâ€™ll need to set the application key :
docker-compose exec -T app php artisan key:generate

This application will be accessed by port 8000.

To run the application go to: 127.0.0.1:8000

Once that's done, you should be able to access the application on the IP that docker (or Docker Machine, or at symfony.dev:81) is running at.
